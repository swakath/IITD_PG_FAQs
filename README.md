## What is this?
Hello Reader, My name is [S U Swakath](https://www.linkedin.com/in/swakath-umamakeshwaran-57b2a717b?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base_contact_details%3BceBgM1LuTQqpY2hsAvvp6g%3D%3D). I am currently a 2nd Year M.Tech CSE student at IIT Delhi. I am writing this short write-up for PG students who are joining IIT Delhi in the academic year 2024-25.

## Accommodation and Hostel
There is a hostel crisis at IIT Delhi, PG students will not get a hostel in the first semester. However, the administration exempts female students, students with special needs and foreign nationals from this rule and tries to provide them with a Hostel. In our batch, all female students got hostel accommodation in the first semester.

Most of the students who did not get a hostel on campus in the first semester lived in residential clusters around IIT Delhi campus, namely Jia Sarai, Katwaria Sarai and Ber Sarai. All these areas are crowded and the overall hygiene factor is slightly lower than average. In short they are not dream lands, one needs to compromise to stay in here

Jia Sarai and Katwaria Sarai share a gate with the IIT Campus, most of the important builds on the campus are within 15-minute walk for these localities. Entry through these gates is allowed between 5 AM to 11:59 PM but exit is allowed 24x7. These are the most suitable locations if accessibility is your priority.
