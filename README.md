# IITD_PG_FAQs
## What is this?
Hello Reader, My name is [S U Swakath](https://www.linkedin.com/in/swakath-umamakeshwaran-57b2a717b?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base_contact_details%3BceBgM1LuTQqpY2hsAvvp6g%3D%3D). I am currently a 2nd Year M.Tech CSE student at IIT Delhi. I am writing this short write-up for PG students joining IIT Delhi in the academic year 2024-25. 

## Disclaimer
The information on this page is based on my past experiences at IIT Delhi and aims to address some common questions. It does not represent official IIT Delhi policies. For all official announcements regarding PG admissions, please visit https://home.iitd.ac.in/pg-admissions.php.

## Accommodation and Hostel

There is a hostel crisis at IIT Delhi, and postgraduate students will not get a hostel in the first semester. However, the administration exempts female students, students with special needs, and foreign nationals from this rule. All female students in our batch received hostel accommodation in the first semester.

### Localities
Most of the students who did not get a hostel on campus opted for Paying Guest (PG) accommodations in residential clusters around the IIT Delhi campus, such as  [Jia Sarai](https://maps.app.goo.gl/fZ6Z5KApnVkt8Gqw6), [Katwaria Sarai](https://maps.app.goo.gl/KEBvNBBpBwvKcHMR8) and [Ber Sarai](https://maps.app.goo.gl/q8JWcQ2h5gU1D7iL6). These areas are crowded, and the overall hygiene factor is slightly below average. In short, they are not dreamlands, and one needs to compromise to stay here.

Jia Sarai and Katwaria Sarai share a gate with the IIT campus, with most important buildings on the campus within a 15-minute walk from these localities. Entry through these gates is allowed between 5 AM and 11:59 PM, but exit is allowed 24/7. Most residents here are IIT students. These are the most suitable locations if **accessibility is your priority**. Ber Sarai, on the other hand, is slightly farther from the IIT campus, requiring a 15-minute cycle ride to commute. It is slightly less congested than the other two localities.

A few students opted for rooms in a locality called [Munirka](https://maps.app.goo.gl/R5GarUDLBJ9jo7ok6). It is farther, more congested, and many residents are not students. Therefore, I always recommend Jia Sarai and Ber Sarai over this place.

There are many more options, such as renting a flat with friends (at least 6-7 km away), which many PhD students do. However, I have listed only the most commonly used options by Master's students.

### Rooms
In all these locations, you can easily find a PG with a plethora of options to choose from, such as AC/Non-AC, independent rooms, or shared rooms, with or without food. Most of us stayed in double sharing or independent rooms. On average, room rent (combined) for an AC room costs ₹12,000-14,000, while a Non-AC room costs ₹10,000-12,000, with electricity and food charges extra. If you are in a double sharing room, the rent and electricity will be divided equally. Electricity is charged at ₹9 per unit. Based on average consumption, an AC room costs ₹2000-4000 for electricity, and a Non-AC room costs around ₹1000. So, in summary, if a person lives in double sharing with AC, it will cost them ₹7500-9000, and without AC, it will cost ₹6000-7000, for room rent and electricity.

Most PGs have washing machines included. Additionally, there are many laundry services available online and within the campus, costing ₹65-80 per kg. I used the service from [UClean](https://www.uclean.in/).

### Food
Most of the PGs provide food, charging around ₹150-200 per day for three meals. You can also subscribe to the IIT mess, which charges day scholars ₹250 per day for three meals. You can choose any mess of your choice and either buy mess coupons or get a monthly mess card. I always recommend opting for an IIT mess subscription over PG food. Though it is costlier, the food is very hygienic and offers a much larger variety of options compared to PG food. 

### Budget 
Based on the above discussions, I have constructed a table with a worst-case budget. Students will definitely spend less than this and can always make many cuts. So, consider this table with a pinch of salt—no need to panic.

|Service|Sharing Non-AC|Sharing AC|Independent Non-AC|
|---|----|---|---|
|Room|6000|8000|12000|
|Electricity|1000|2000|1000|
|Laundary|500|500|500|
|Food|7500|7500|7500|
|Total|15000|18000|21000|

### Hope
The hope is that you will get an old hostel within the campus by the end of January during your second semester. We all received campus accommodation by this time. The hostel allocation was done through a lottery system, and we got both double sharing and individual rooms. Getting an individual room proves your luck.

### Incampus accomodation cost
The [Board for Hostel Management](https://bhm.iitd.ac.in/) (BHM) at IIT Delhi is the main body that takes care of hostel-related matters. They have issued a circular regarding the hostel charges for Semester 1 of the academic year 2024-25. I am attaching the circular [here](https://bhm.iitd.ac.in/static/media/HostelCharges.fbefc5fe8aecfcb9890f.pdf); you can go through it for exact costs. For additional information regarding hostel policies, you can visit the [Resources page](https://bhm.iitd.ac.in/resources) for BHM IIT Delhi.

# Academics
IIT Delhi has a document called "[Courses of Study](https://home.iitd.ac.in/uploads/course-of-study/Courses%20of%20Study%202023-24.pdf)", which is considered the Bhagavad Gita when it comes to academic matters at IIT Delhi. I'm pretty sure that no living person has read this document completely. You go through this to understand the grading system, your program's curriculum, and course options in detail. This document gets updated every academic year, but the basic structure remains more or less similar.

## M.Tech Computer Science and Engineering

I have filtered out the course curriculum of M.Tech CSE from the "Courses of Study" and attached it [here](documents/courses_of_study_MCS.pdf). The following table is from the same document. ![Credit Requirements](documents\credit_requirements.png)
